## 🌸 About The Project

This is a small, personal and creative React application I built to surprise someone very special in my life — Sushi.

Instead of a simple message, I wanted to create something fun, interactive, and memorable.

So this app:

* asks a cute Valentine-style question  
* makes the *“No” button run away / shrink / change text* 😄  
* shows funny dialogue reactions  
* has a *Love Progress meter* ❤️  
* plays sound effects  
* celebrates with floating hearts + animations  
* generates a *Valentine Acceptance Certificate*  
* allows downloading the certificate as an image  
* includes small inside jokes & personalized touches  

The goal wasn’t just code — it was to create an experience that feels warm, playful, and emotional.

This project reflects both:
- my learning in React
- and something meaningful from my personal life

❤️ Why I Built This

Sometimes words aren’t enough.

So I coded them instead.

This project is a small reminder that:

> love can be expressed through creativity too.
